## Learner Persona

-   Vaida, 33, has a PhD in oceanography
    and now works as a data analyst for the Ministry of the Environment.
-   Vaida has been collecting and publishing beach erosion data for the past six years.
    She also co-founded a volunteer group that teaches environmental science to high school students,
    and has been its leader for the past five years.
-   Vaida is relocating to pursue a new career opportunity,
    so she wants to wind down her data collection project.
    She also wants the volunteer group to continue its work,
    but the only documentation of how it operates is
    one slide deck and a couple of out-of-date blog posts.
-   Vaida is working hard to prepare for her new job,
    which means only has two or three hours a week for the next couple of months
    to put into tidying things up.

This workshop teaches Vaida how to shut down a project gracefully
or hand one over to new leadership.
